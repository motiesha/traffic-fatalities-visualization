# Visualization of 2015 Traffic Fatalities on Google Maps

In this project, Python, Google Maps API, and JavaScript are utilized to generate an HTML file that contains the heatmap of traffic fatalities within Los Angeles and Orange County areas.

The [dataset](ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/2015/) is [released by U.S. department of transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/2015-traffic-fatalities-data-has-just-been-released-call-action-download-and-analyze).

### Instructions to generate the HTML file
* Download the `accident.csv` and `main.py`
* Run `main.py`
* It will generate an HTML file named `output.html` that contains the google map with the heatmap.
